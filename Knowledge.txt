🧠 Project Name:
"Neuromorphic Network Controller with SNNs and STDP-Based Adaptive Routing"

🔍 What Is This Project?

This project simulates a smart computer network — like the kind used in the internet, data centers, or mobile networks — but controlled by brain-inspired AI instead of regular algorithms.

We use a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), which is a type of artificial neural network that mimics how actual brain neurons work (with electrical spikes instead of plain numbers). It learns in a biological way using something called STDP (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity) — this means the network learns automatically based on timing of spikes.

🧪 Real-World Analogy (Simple Example)

Imagine a network of 6 routers in a circular loop. Each router decides which direction to forward internet traffic.

Now imagine these routers have tiny brain-like agents that watch the traffic and fire electrical spikes to indicate which direction has the least delay or best capacity.

If one router suddenly goes down (say due to a cyberattack or hardware failure), the rest of the network adapts and reroutes traffic — without needing to reboot or reprogram anything.

It’s like your brain finding a new walking path when you hit traffic — automatically.

💡 What Are the Smart Features?

Feature	How It Works
Example
🔁 Live Routing	Chooses best traffic paths based on brain-like activity	If Node 1 is too busy, use Node 2 and 3
⚡ Spiking Neurons	Each router's decision is made using biologically inspired SNNs	Neuron spikes mean “go this way”
🧠 STDP Learning	Learns from timing of traffic spikes (like human brain)	“Last time this path was fast — let’s reuse it”
💥 Attack/Failure Recovery	If a router fails (simulated attack), system reroutes	Node 4 fails → reroute via 2 → 5
📊 Dashboard	Professors can simulate failures and see how it reacts	Move a slider to disable Node 3, see results live
